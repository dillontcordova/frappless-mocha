# frappless-mocha

An extension of mocha, to create a method to traverse the same integration tests that you made for your code, as e2e tests as well. In addition it adds AWS/nock mocking capability. This is all wrapped so that when e2e tests are running, all mocking capabilities are shut off without altering code.
